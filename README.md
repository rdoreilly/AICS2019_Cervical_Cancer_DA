The repository contains code used to perform comparative data analytics on a cervical cancer risk factor dataset. The results of which are detailed in the paper ''A Comparative Analysis of Classification Techniques for Cervical Cancer Utilising At Risk Factors and Screening Test Results'' [available here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7227/71e295aec8b2c96c988cbdfdf85798684b9b.pdf) presented as part of The 27th Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science.
